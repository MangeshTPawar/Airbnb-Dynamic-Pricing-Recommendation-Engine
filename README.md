# Airbnb-Dynamic-Pricing-Recommendation-Engine


## Description: 
  A machine learning project that analyzes Airbnb listing data to predict optimal daily prices.
  The engine empowers hosts to maximize revenue by providing dynamic, data-driven pricing
  recommendations based on listing features, location, and seasonality.



## Key_features:
  - Comprehensive Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in over 35 columns.
  - In-depth EDA: Visual analysis of price drivers like location, room type, and seasonality.
  - Feature Engineering: Created new features like host tenure and amenity flags.
  - Predictive Modeling: Trained and evaluated 5 regression models to predict prices.
  - Interactive UI: Built a simple recommendation interface using ipywidgets.

## Tech_stack:
  - Language: Python
  - Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - ipywidgets
  - Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Workflow:
  - 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - 3. Feature Engineering
  - 4. Model Building & Evaluation
  - 5. Recommendation Engine Development

## key_result:
  best_model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
  performance: Achieved an R-squared (RÂ²) score of 0.97, explaining 97% of the price variance.
